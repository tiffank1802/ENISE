\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
Currently a fifth-year student in a double degree program at the École Nationale d’Ingénieurs de Saint-Étienne (ENISE), I am eager to take the opportunity to apply for the internship offer available.
Passionate about mechanics, I have oriented my studies in this field to contribute to the technological advances revolutionizing design and production processes. 

As a driving member of the group, I see myself as a hardworking person, someone reliable who completes tasks efficiently and adapts flexibly to academic and professional projects.
My weakness is sometimes being a perfectionist in situations that do not require it—a flaw I have been working on for quite some time now.
\lettersection{Why CEA?}
CEA offers a unique environment at the intersection of scientific excellence and major societal challenges, notably in innovative research on materials, mechanics, and thermal sciences. I am particularly attracted by the CEA's multidisciplinary and collaborative approach, where teamwork, autonomy, and communication are highly valued. The opportunity to be involved in advanced numerical simulation, dynamic modeling, and experimental characterization fits perfectly with my academic path and career goals.

CEA's projects require interns to demonstrate strong analytical skills, motivation for scientific problem-solving, familiarity with simulation software (such as Abaqus, LS-DYNA, Python, or Matlab), as well as the ability to work both independently and as part of a team. The possibility to work on concrete applications related to mechanical and thermal behavior of innovative materials in a cutting-edge research facility is truly motivating. I am eager to contribute my skills to such an ambitious and dynamic context.



\lettersection{Why Me?}
Throughout my education, I have developed a solid foundation in mechanics and materials science, with practical experience in numerical modeling and programming. My proficiency in Python and my adaptability with other scientific software enable me to quickly take on simulation and data analysis tasks. I am recognized for my organizational skills, resourcefulness, and the ability to work effectively in multidisciplinary teams. My commitment to continuous learning and my drive to contribute to high-level technical projects make me a strong fit for CEA's expectations for interns.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background, skills, and enthusiasm can add value to CEA. Please feel free to contact me at your convenience.
