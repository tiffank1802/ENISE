\lettersection{About Me}
As a fifth-year Mechanical Engineering student specializing in numerical simulation at Centrale Lyon-ENISE, I am writing to express my strong interest in the internship focused on "Simulation Multiphysique et Intelligence Artificielle" at GE Vernova Grid Solutions. My academic background in mechanical engineering, coupled with my experience in numerical modeling, programming, and multiphysics simulations, aligns perfectly with the requirements of this research project.

\lettersection{Why This Internship?}
The challenge of performing multiphysics simulations of high-voltage circuit breakers and developing AI models for breaking criteria prediction represents exactly the type of innovative engineering problem that drives my passion. This opportunity particularly appeals to me for several reasons:
• The project combines advanced multiphysics simulation (solid and fluid mechanics, thermodynamics) with machine learning applications in the energy sector
• It contributes to the energy transition by improving grid technologies for a decarbonized and secure energy future
• The use of simulations to build databases and develop neural models or other ML approaches represents a cutting-edge method in electrical engineering
• Working at GE Vernova, a leader in energy solutions with over 130 years of experience, offers invaluable industrial exposure in a global context
The interdisciplinary nature of this internship, involving simulation, programming, and AI in the context of high-voltage equipment, provides an ideal environment for academic and professional growth.

\lettersection{Why My Profile Fits?}
Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in numerical methods and programming that directly applies to this internship:
• \textbf{Numerical Modeling:} My Master's specialization in Numerical Solid Mechanics has provided me with advanced knowledge of computational methods, including mechanics of solids and fluids, and thermodynamic simulations
• \textbf{Programming Skills:} I have substantial experience with Python development, including my work on microstructure partitioning models at École des Mines de Saint-Étienne, and potential for additional Python development tasks
• \textbf{MATLAB Proficiency:} I have completed multiple MATLAB certifications (Simulink, Power System OnRamp, Computer Vision), with Power Systems being particularly relevant to energy grid applications
• \textbf{Mechanical Understanding:} My background in mechanical engineering gives me the necessary foundation to understand circuit breaker mechanics and multiphysics phenomena
• \textbf{Research Experience:} My fatigue analysis project involving numerical method validation, along with exposure to CFD concepts, has prepared me for building simulation databases and AI model development
My experience in developing Python models for material analysis, combined with my MATLAB expertise (including Simulink for system modeling) and mechanical engineering background, positions me well to contribute to the multiphysics simulations (1D-CFD) and machine learning aspects of this project. While I am eager to learn AMESim, my strong programming foundation and adaptability will enable quick mastery of required tools.

I am particularly excited about contributing to GE Vernova's mission in the energy sector and the potential to apply AI to real-world industrial challenges. This internship aligns perfectly with my career aspirations in simulation and intelligent systems for sustainable energy.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my technical skills, curiosity, and innovative spirit align well with your requirements, and I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your team's important work on high-voltage circuit breaker simulations.
