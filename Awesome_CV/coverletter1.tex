\lettersection{About Me}
As a fifth-year Mechanical Engineering student specializing in numerical simulation at Centrale Lyon-ENISE, I am writing to express my strong interest in the internship focused on "Modeling of Granular Segregation Phenomena using Inhomogeneous Markov Chains." My academic background in mechanical engineering, coupled with my extensive experience in numerical modeling and programming, aligns perfectly with the requirements of this research project.

\lettersection{Why This Internship?}
The challenge of modeling granular mixing processes represents exactly the type of complex mechanical problem that drives my passion for engineering. The opportunity to work on stochastic modeling using inhomogeneous Markov chains to predict segregation phenomena in granular materials particularly appeals to me for several reasons:

• The project bridges fundamental research and industrial applications in sectors I find compelling - pharmaceuticals, food processing, and energy
• It combines advanced mathematical modeling with practical engineering applications
• The use of DEM simulations to develop stochastic models represents a cutting-edge approach to granular flow analysis
• The possibility to contribute to digital twin development for industrial processes aligns with my career aspirations

The interdisciplinary nature of this research, involving collaboration between IMT Mines Albi and IMT Mines Saint-Étienne, provides an ideal environment for academic and professional growth.

\lettersection{Why My Profile Fits?}
Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in numerical methods and programming that directly applies to this internship:

• \textbf{Numerical Modeling:} My Master's specialization in Numerical Solid Mechanics has provided me with advanced knowledge of computational methods and simulation techniques
• \textbf{Programming Skills:} I have substantial experience with Python development, including my work on microstructure partitioning models at École des Mines de Saint-Étienne
• \textbf{MATLAB Proficiency:} I have completed multiple MATLAB certifications (Simulink, Power System OnRamp, Computer Vision) demonstrating my capability with scientific computing
• \textbf{Mechanical Understanding:} My background in mechanical engineering gives me the necessary foundation to understand granular material behavior and flow mechanics
• \textbf{Research Experience:} My fatigue analysis project involving numerical method validation has prepared me for rigorous research work

My experience in developing Python models for material analysis, combined with my MATLAB expertise and mechanical engineering background, positions me well to contribute to the DEM simulation analysis and Markov chain modeling required for this project.

I am particularly excited about the prospect of working on a project that has both strong academic value and immediate industrial applications. The opportunity to potentially continue this research through a PhD pathway is also highly appealing.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my technical skills and research capabilities align well with your requirements, and I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your team's important work on granular flow modeling.
